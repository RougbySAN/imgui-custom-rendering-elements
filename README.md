<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

At first, this project was a necessity for another project I was working on. This project initially aimed to link draggable items with orthogonal lines, similar to tools like draw.io or MS Visio in my Dear ImGui setup. But as I worked on it, I saw the potential for something biggerâ€”a user-friendly element list on the side, letting users create cool flowcharts and system designs hassle-free. It's an extension of the Dear ImGui custom rendering demo in the demo window, and I plan to add more elements and features down the line!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The project can be used for gui applications where a heavy visualization is required for the user such as flowcharts or design blocks for projects with Dear Imgui as the library. The canvas
with many more additional elements can be used to implement a draw.io or MS Visio like interface for Dear Imgui applications.
